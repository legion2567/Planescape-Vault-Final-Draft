# Changelog

## 2.1 Release | 23/08/25

There are a LOT of changes from 2.0 to 2.1, too many to cover for each and every small change. What I recommend is having a read through the [[README]] to best understand the vault as a whole. If you are coming from 2.0, the methodology of the notes are mostly the same, but with some improvements. But now we are doing a lot of our organisation of data through bases.

## 26/08/25

- Added [[Template - Creature]]
- Added [[PlaceholderCreature.png]]
- Added Creature QuickAdd and Button to [[Buttons]].
- Various spells or grammar corrections in [[README]]
- Changed the [[Notepad]] '#Notepad' tag to 'Notepad'.
- Fixed the display for linkedAdventure in [[Template - Quest]]
- Removed references of the old 'domain' property in databases.
- Deleted an unused Database.

## 03/09/25

- Replaced the Manual Sorting plugin with Custom File Explorer plugin [[README#[Custom File Explorer Sorting](https //github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort)]]. This **SHOULD** help resolve some lag issues.
- Fixed the second Aliases in [[Template - Deity]] to say pronouns.
- Disabled SCallouts snippet by default
	- Changed ITS/SCallouts to FaS by default. If you change themes, you will need to edit these yourself.
- Updated leaflets to include the formatting to allow multiple layers as standard.

## 12/09/25

- Cleaned up various infoboxes.
- Added `pronounced` property and display to the following:
	- [[Template - Player]]
	- [[Template - Deity]]
	- [[Template - NPC]]
	- [[Template - NPC (Tabs)]]
- Added `titles` property and Infobox dIsplay to the following:
	- [[Template - Player]]
	- [[Template - NPC]]
	- [[Template - NPC (Tabs)]]

## 05/10/25

- Added the [Retroma](https://github.com/emarpiee/Retroma) theme as an option within the vault.
- Update Maps to have a overlay by default to better showcase the available feature.
- Moved all location folders to a parent Locations folder in campaign.
	- Updated all QuickAdd options to use these new folders.
	- Updated all bases to use these new folders.
- Added the [[Database - Location Master.base]], see [[README#Database - Location Master.base]] for more details.
- Enabled property viewer in the left-hand pane by default. This can be removed if you don't like it.
- Updated the README to explain more about the removal of metadata tabs and how to best use properties. See [[README#Where did the Metadata tab go from 2.0?]]
