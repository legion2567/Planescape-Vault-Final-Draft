### Cosmography:

> <font color="#7f7f7f">The Outlands is a realm equidistant from all other Outer Planes, a vast landscape which acts as the hub of the Great Wheel. Maps often represent this plane as a circle, with different slices of the Outlands each representing an inclination towards specific ideologies and the Outer Planes which embody them. Such depictions fail to encapsulate the Outlands’ infinite size or its ever-shifting landscape, for the evolving state of cosmic belief means that no trek through the “Center of Ideas” will ever follow the same course twice.</font>

**Other Names:** The Concordant Opposition, the Passage to Everywhere
**Creature Themes:** All
**Hallmarks:** Portals, gate-towns, rilmani, the Spire
**Sample Portal Keys:** A promise of safe passage from a rilmani; a shard chiseled from the Spire; a macaronic poem with verses written in Abyssal, Infernal, and Celestial
### Common Knowledge
Those familiar with the Outlands know the following facts:
- The Outlands act as a hub for the Outer Planes, and all of them are connected to the Outlands via portals.
- The geography of the Outlands shifts continually based on belief, and while all known locations are quickly accessible it is possible for places to move to and from other planes.
- At the center of the Outlands is the Spire, an infinitely tall tower which hosts the city of Sigil and has the capacity to suppress magic.

> *"I tells ya true, its blekking peery! You’ll ne’er see one of them alone, they always go out in pairs at least. Its like The Us. What? You don’t know The Us?! Cranium rats what share a mind, run loose in the Cage. Them Dabus are like that, seem to share a mind. Unsavory, to say the least! It ain’t no salad-story cutter. Watch their eyes.”* **—Ving The Nose, a bubber in Sigil**

## Unique Environmental Effects
Antimagic is an iconic part of the Concordant Opposition. You can use either of these two rules to represent that. *Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse* uses the simpler Antimagic Pockets rule. Traditionally, the Nine Rings rule and variants of it were used in earlier editions of the game. 

**Antimagic Pockets.** Slow-moving bubbles of antimagic drift around the Spire, but don’t reach out as far as the gate-towns or as high up as Sigil. The space within these pockets function like an antimagic field spell. The DM decides the size and shape of each pocket, such as whether it covers an entire room, building, battlefield, or settlement, or only part of one of these. These usually move on to another location within an hour, regardless of the size.

Within the Spire, anytime a creature casts a spell, there is a 10 percent chance it triggers an antimagic field spell, centered on the caster and lasting for 5 minutes.

**Nine Rings.** Nine invisible, concentric circles are centered on the Spire, known as the Rings. As you travel closer to the Spire (called “spireward”), antimagic properties gradually set in. As you travel away from the Spire (called “ringward”), magic slowly returns to normal functioning.

In the outermost rings, magic functions normally for most spells and magic items, but many powerful magical effects are suppressed, as if within an antimagic field spell. In the innermost rings, most magical effects are suppressed in the same way. The Nine Rings table describes which spell levels and magic items function normally within each ring.
Artifact-rarity magic items, spells cast by deities, and interplanar vehicles ignore the effects of the Nine Rings. For magical effects that aren’t spells or magic items, such as a dragon’s breath weapons or **vampire’s** Charm ability, the DM decides whether each effect functions in a given ring based on how it compares to spells and magic items that do function in the ring. Magically innate movement speeds, like a **beholder’s** flying speed, ignore the effects of the Nine Rings.

All gate-towns are in the 9th ring. Sigil floats around the top of the infinitely tall Spire and ignores all antimagic effects of the Outlands. The DM can decide what rings other major landmarks are set in.

## Outlands Supernatural Effects
Consider rolling on the Outlands Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:
- A creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that interacts with one of the Outer Planes (like reaching the Nine Hells with the plane shift spell or banishing a celestial with the banishment spell).
- A creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect originating from a cleric or other creature channeling the supernatural powers of a deity.
- A creature makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to establish an agreement or pact, or a similar ability check.

### Outlands Effects

| d12 | Outlands Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | A random creature currently under the effects of a spell or another magical influence is targeted by the dispel evil and good spell and the remove curse spell. If no such creature is currently in the region, then a random creature gains the ability to cast each of these spells once as a charm, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | The balancing powers of the Outlands make it easier to smite creatures embodying the extreme philosophies of the Outer Planes. Over the next 24 hours, creatures within the region have advantage on attack rolls against creatures native to the Outer Planes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3   | The relative space of the plane bends in unexpected ways. Choose one random creature within the region: the target and each other creature within 60 feet is magically transported to a location within the region close to where the random creature would like to be the most (in case of doubt, the DM can ask the player of a targeted character what this place would be), as if the creatures were arriving in the location through the plane shift spell. If the DM wishes so, the creatures will encounter an NPC or location that is meaningful for the targets. |
| 4   | The influence of the Outlands interferes with the creature’s capacity to interact with extraplanar beings. Over the next 24 hours, anyone summoning a creature native to an Outer Plane or magically communicating with it (like with the commune spell) takes 3d10 force damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5   | A random creature within the region receives the effects of the divination spell (which can consist of visions or similar omens, at the DM’s choice) regarding an event about concordance or balance. The target makes a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save because of the mental strain of holding the weight of the cosmos’ balance in a single mind.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6   | Over the next 24 hours, creatures native to the Outer Planes are stripped of their natural protection against magic by the neutral powers of the Outlands, and made more susceptible to it. During this time, these creatures lose the Magic Resistance feature if they have it, and have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 7   | A portal to a random Outer Plane or to the city of Sigil appears. If the DM wishes so, the portal is guarded by a creature that might threaten the characters, ask for payment, or require the characters to fulfill another favor to grant passage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 8   | A random creature within the region gains the ability to cast the knock spell once as a charm. The creature can use it on a closed portal within 5 feet, and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the portal opens. The DM can define a higher or lower DC based on the portal’s characteristics and nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9   | The energies of the Outlands balance the magical capacity of the region’s visitors. The metaconcert spell (see chapter 1) is immediately cast on a random creature within the region. The target can make decisions on the spell’s effect as if it cast it. The spell has a duration of 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10  | A protection from evil and good spell, fueled by the plane’s concordant energies, targets a random creature within the region and lasts 8 hours or until dispelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11  | Roll an effect from the plane related to the closest gate-town, if any. If none are close enough (DM’s choice), roll again on this table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12  | The energies of two Outer Planes are clashing. Roll twice as per the table effect above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
