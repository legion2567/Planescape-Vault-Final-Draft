# Bag of Tips' TTRPG Template Vault v2.1

> [!kirk|info] Tip
Looking for something specific? Use the Outline tab in the top left.

## Introduction

I still consider myself relatively new to the TTRPG world, jumping straight in as a player in one campaign and running my own as a GM in another. But I have spent a lot of time reading, watching, and talking to other game masters, learning all I can to better myself and my games. However, when it came to either being a player or running my own games, there was always one thing that frustrated me, and that was taking notes.

I explored various note-taking methods, including Word, Google Docs, OneNote, and several websites. However, none of them fit what I was looking for in a note-taking tool. So I was left looking for something else. Then one day, I stumbled upon Obsidian, a tool that allowed me to create notes and organise them by linking those notes together, whilst making them visually appealing with various plugins and markdown. After delving further, I found that there was a large TTRPG community, and within it, various plugins they developed to aid us in making our games even better.

I was hooked. I had discovered an amazing tool that allowed me to work in a way that suited me, enabling me to organise my notes as I wanted, without being limited by the constraints of predefined boxes and parameters. Additionally, the community of developers within the TTRPG community provided us with numerous powerful tools to aid in our work. I spent a lot of time developing my own notes, discovering different ways to do things, finding ways that they shouldn't be done, talking with members of the community and learning from the fountain of knowledge they held, and just experimenting and having fun with it.

After a while, I started sharing my notes and templates, helping members in the community with their questions on how they should get started and recommendations on how to organise their notes/vaults. Whilst they weren't perfect, I would always share them to give people ideas on what they could do. As interest in this grew, I started making YouTube videos to showcase my work and give people a better idea of what they can do. However, I began to feel that I could improve on the templates I was sharing. It was at this time that I decided to leave the ones that I had made without too much thought, for free access, and started focusing deeply on the ones you see today. The ones where I put a lot of time and effort thinking about the techniques and methodology of how notes come together, and how we actually use them as game masters.

Over the years learning and playing TTRPGs, I found a passion for sharing what I know and helping others find what works for them. That's very much what I do now, within the TTRPG community—offering my work to those interested, and lending an ear to those who need inspiration. If you're interested in hearing what I have to say or want to gain any insight from my experiences, then please come and watch my YouTube videos, check out my Ko-fi, and join the Discord.

If you want to get involved in these creations and improve our games together, come say hi! Until then, however, I hope you enjoy my TTRPG template vault. I hope it brings value to you, your players, and your games.

## Overview

This vault is designed to house all of your notes for your TTRPG world. And when I say notes, I mean information about your characters, such as their names, locations, interests, desires, etc. My personal methodology is to keep the game separate from my notes, so I tend to keep all my player sheets, monster stat blocks, and items within my virtual tabletop of choice. However, many people choose to bring all this information into their personal vaults, and many have great success with that. It all comes down to personal preference.

The main goal of this vault is to simplify note creation, so you can focus less on organization and more on making your notes easy to read. This way, you can spend more time building your world and putting time where it counts. With that being said, you may find some details lacking, such as characters, stats, and abilities. This is because I am focusing purely on the notes rather than the system.

However, this is now your vault! So do with it as you please. Feel free to put in all your game system information if you so wish, and change the templates to your preference. There's nothing stopping you from making this vault your own.

**This covers the 2.0 version of the vault; I'll make a new video for 2.1. However, this should cover the majority of how the vault works.**

## FAQ

### Where do I start?

So, for a new user picking this up for the first time, everything might be a little overwhelming, as you don't know where to begin, and that's completely understandable. Firstly, I recommend reading through the entirety of this README as well as exploring the Templates as you do so. Doing this, you can start to see how everything works. I also recommend creating a throwaway vault using this template vault (a copy that you can delete later) as a playground to test. If something breaks, you can use that as a learning experience, and it will help grow your understanding. I recommend not changing anything within the templates themselves until you are confident you want them to be changed. To start playing around with the notes, you'll want to create a new note for the template you want to mess around in, such as an NPC (Non-player Character). This can be accessed through [[Buttons]].

Once you're confident you have a grasp on the basics, I recommend starting at the highest point for your campaign or one-shot. By that, I mean the locations. If your one-shot is taking place in a town, you'll want to have the town, the topography that it's located in, and then the planet, just so you have the name of the planet. Whilst creating the planet now might sound like a lot for just a one-shot, all this is doing is making a note as a placeholder for all of this information. It's simply going to have a name we put in, and that's it. From there, we just do the same with the topography, and then we move down to the settlement, where we can start fleshing it out with all the NPCs, Locations, etc.

### How do I create a new note?

<u>Option A:</u> Add a new note by using 'CTRL + NUMPAD +'. You can now select a template to use, and it will automatically be added into the correct folder for you. (You are more than welcome to edit the folders, but will need to edit the QuickAdd settings.)
<u>Option B:</u> Use the buttons on the right-hand side tab. (You are more than welcome to edit the buttons, but will need to edit the QuickAdd settings.)

### Help! Plugins aren't working!

Make sure when you extracted the folder, you didn't have a folder within a folder. The file path should be `C:\Documents > Obsidian Vaults > TTRPG Templates X.X` or something similar, depending on where you have put it. Then, it should look like the image below.

Another reason they may not be working is that when you opened the vault, a pop-up asked if you wanted to enable the community plugins, and you clicked no. To fix this, simply go to your settings, then to community plugins, and disable the restricted mode.

### Noticing Lag?

Recently some members of the community have been experiencing more and more lag when it comes to Obsidian. I have done what I can to try help resolve this on my end, but if you experience issues yourself here is what I recommend:
- Disable all plugins, if it still lags, you really have a problem.
- Disable 1 plugin at a time and test.
- Change the theme and test.

Work your way like this and record your findings, if you notice a specific plugin or theme is causing issues, contact the developer through their GitHub issues. If you notice issues with Obsidian itself, please report it on the [Obsidian Forum: Bug Reports](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/bug-reports/7).

### Can you add <<...>> from this specific TTRPG system?

More often than not, the answer is "no." This is simply because this vault is designed to be primarily for notes only. You may notice that I have some items in here which are specifically for Pf2e, but that's simply because that is a system I'm running on, and it gives us a foundation to work from. If you want to add your own races, items, creatures, etc, you will need to do that work yourself. The same goes for any kind of gameplay system, such as a character sheet or a calculator for experience.

### How do I make a Player Character Sheet that tracks my players' Stats, Inventory, AC, etc?

Just don't, that's my advice. Over the years of working with Obsidian, I have seen many people try to create character sheets. Each has its own various levels of success, but ultimately, I see them all fail. What we're doing here in Obsidian is already pushing the limits of how this program works. If you want a constant project where you're constantly maintaining and fixing bugs for your character sheet, then by all means, go for it. Not to mention going through each character every session to update these notes. I personally say a game master has way too much on their plate already, let alone having to double up the workload of maintaining a character sheet when players should be doing that themselves.

There's a reason why companies such as D&D Beyond have an entire team dedicated to making these systems. They're very complex and break, requiring constant adjustments and changes. I suggest keeping the vaults for pure notes and using a website with teams dedicated to doing this for you.

### Where is the <<...>> Template?

Depending on the template you're referring to, there are three possible answers. Either it's being worked on behind the scenes and will be released further down the line (I usually have a placeholder folder ready for it), I don't plan to work on it, or it's something I haven't thought of yet.

### Why does it break when I move the templates into my old vault?

The reason for this is that the templates are only one part of this vault. The other parts include the plugins and all the settings alongside them. While you can move notes from this vault to an older one, I recommend using this vault as the primary, as all settings and templates have been correctly set up. However, if you would like to use an older vault, you will need to review the settings and ensure they are set up correctly yourself.

### Is there any better Audio File support?

Sadly, Obsidian's audio files lack sufficient support, making it impossible to automate their creation or select them with Meta-bind. When working with audio files, move them into the Z_Audio folder to keep them organized and manually reference them in your notes as needed.

### I found an issue. How do I report it?

Well, bugger. I must have missed something. Not a problem. Feel free to pop over to the Discord channel and let me know!

---

### How can I change the style?

#### Changing the Theme

Primarily, the vault uses the FaS ([Fancy a Story](https://github.com/elsatam/obsidian-fancy-a-story)) theme; however, you are more than welcome to change that. Another great theme that you can change to without much issue is the ITS ([In The Shadows](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme)) theme. You can use other themes, though their support and customizability may vary. If you do change to something other than these, you may find these [snippets](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/tree/main/Snippets) useful.

#### Colours

Most colours within this vault are determined through the ITS or FaS Settings within the Style Settings plugin.

#### Note Style

To change the style of the notes, from their colour to the emojis, go to both the SuperchargedLinks and Style Settings > SuperchargedLinks sections.

#### Callouts

To change the colours and icons of the callouts, you can find these in the Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets > Click the folder icon > double click BOTCalloutsDarkmode

## Tips & Tricks



### Don't want things to break?

Like any piece of software, updates come with new bugs and breakages. This usually means that templates or settings need to be updated. If you prefer not to deal with the hassle of updating and resolving potential issues that may arise with each update, consider keeping automatic updates turned off to ensure your vault remains operational. You can find this setting in Settings>General. However, do note that this means you won't be able to access any new content that may come along with both official and community plugin updates.

If you choose to update, you do so at your own risk, so please be sure to make backups. We are happy to help in the Discord channel, but we cannot guarantee it won't break anything.
![[AutomaticUpdates.png]]

### Better Time-Saving Templates

Depending on your setting and how you like to work, you can set options within your templates so they're ready for you to use straight away. For example, any NPC you create might, for the most part, be "unmet" by your party. So, consider setting that within the template. Other examples could be marking them as "Healthy," or their language as "Common."

### Where did the Metadata tab go from 2.0?

It's gone! Now, we use Obsidian's "properties" at the top of the note, which can be collapsed when not in use. They're great, because you can type directly into any property field. Then, once you have made an input in one note, it will be suggested in all other notes with that property after that.

**What makes properties so powerful:**
- When using a property such as currentLocation to set a note's location within your world, you can use link directly to the note using square brackets `[[ ]]`
	- This is great, because it means if we ever rename a note, it will automatically update the link for us.
	- <font color="#7f7f7f">Note: The bases in this vault look for linked notes for properties like currentLocation and organization, so if you don't want to use `[[ ]]` you will need to change these.</font>
- Once you set a value such as a location once, it will forever remember that option and will suggest it in the future.
	- This means, we no longer need to use the Meta Bind plugin as a middle man for our options. We can just set that option once in the note rather than in settings.

### Where are custom frames?

Now that Obsidian has a built-in web browser, I recommend using that for your web browsing needs! However, if you still want that plugin, it's just a download away.

### How to use Bases

Now that Obsidian has officially released Bases, I will work on getting a new video for you all. But in the meantime, most of what I covered in the following video remains relevant, at least in theory, and will give you a good understanding of how it all works. Just bear in mind, some settings or options may vary.

Just a note: with every new thing, there are always issues. If you are experiencing any issues with performance, stability, or functionality, whilst myself and the community can try help, the best place to report these issues are on Obsiidan's forum. (See [[README#Noticing Lag?]])

### How to search better

Use CTRL + SHIFT + F, CTRL + O, or the 🔍 or 🏷️ buttons at the top-left to search for anything you're looking for. All notes have tags to increase the power of this vault. All characters, such as Players, NPCs, and Deities, have the "#Character" tag. All locations, like Settlements, Shops, etc., all have the "#Location" tag, and so on. Some notes get broken down further, such as NPCs with the "#NPC" tag.

Additionally, if you want to search for an NPC you know is in a certain settlement, search for the tag: #NPC tag and the Property: 'currentLocation'. I recommend reviewing the templates to see which notes have specific tags that can aid in your searching.

## Common Properties

Gone are the Meta Bind inputs! We are now using the built-in functions of Properties. Properties, whilst limited at first when just starting up a vault, quickly become very powerful! Before Meta Bind, we had to go to settings, create an option, and then use it. Now, we just have to type it directly into the Property section once, and then it will be suggested every time after that!

### Obsidian Properties

*<font color=" #7f7f7f">The spelling of these properties cannot be changed, as they are defined by Obsidian.</font>*

- **tags**
	- We use tags as the overarching identifiers for a note. Examples include Location, Character, Settlement, NPC
- **aliases**
	- This is used to reference the note using other names. (Example: the note 'Robert' could have the alias of 'Rob').

### Plugin Properties

*<font color=" #7f7f7f">The spelling of these properties cannot be changed, as they are defined by plugins.</font>*

#### Calendarium

- **day**
	- Sets the specific day this event occurs on if it is an annual event.
- **month**
	- Sets the specific month this event occurs in if it is an annual event.

#### Leaflet

- **location**
	- Sets the map marker location for a specific 'Location' on a leaflet.
	- <span style="background:#ff4d4f">TUTORIAL WIP</span>
	- For previous users of my vault, we used to use 'location' to set the locations of characters and other world locations. We now instead use currentLocation. (Explained further down).
- **mapmarker**
	- Sets the marker type to be used. (Specified in Leaflet settings.)

### Bag of Tips Properties

*<font color="#7f7f7f">These properties in theory can be changed. However, if you do change them, I recommend making sure everything works as they may be used in other places around the vault as dataviews, bases, etc.</font>*

- **art**
	- Used to display the primary art for the note.
- **whichParty**
	- Used to specify which one of your parties the note is related to. (Example: a Character note with the property whichParty set to Party A, will display that character with Party A).
- **summary**
	- Used to give a quick understanding of what a note is about, useful for dataviews and bases.
- **rarity**
	- States how rare something is in your setting.
- **completed**

## Note Overview

### Tools

#### [[Vault Hub]] 
The Vault Hub is a place where you can regularly return to help manage your campaign. I have provided you with the basics for displaying your active parties, along with a space for a random note selector that will prompt you to help flesh out your world. However, this is a note that can be easily changed to your preferences.

#### [[Buttons]]
The buttons note, located on the right-hand side in a tab, is a place where you can quickly and easily create new notes, which get automatically sorted into their relevant folders. With some templates, you may be asked which folder you want to place it in. This is usually so you can place it in a folder that is named for a certain party to keep things organised.

#### [[Tab of Lazy Prep]]
The "Tab of Lazy Prep" note is another way you can prep for your games. This is based on the methodology of the [Lazy DM](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_dungeon_master_cc.html) guide, where you can very easily note down any key bits of information, scenes, characters, and anything else that you may need for a session. It also gives you a place to add some backup notes, so if your players do something completely random, you can always have something on hand.

#### [[Notepad]]
The Notepad note is a place where you can note down anything quickly, such as a random quest idea, as well as sorting out any short and long-term goals that you may need to get to.

## Bases Overview

### [[Database - Location Master.base]]

Whilst most bases should be clear with what they do, showing relevant notes with the specified properties. One base that is unique is the Location Master. The location master uses a bit of code not visible in the Obsidian UI, but in the .base file itself, accessible via a text editor such as Virtual Studio Code. The little bit of code this base does is quite unique, which would be best explained in an example.

Normally, we have to set the currentLocation to multiple locations if we wanted to see lets say a character in both a shop and a settlement. But now, we can set the character's location to the shop, and the shop's location to the settlement. Then, both the shop and the character would appear in the base when looking at the settlement! It only looks for one "step" down, so if you want to modify this to look for more steps, you would need to modify this. The base is attached to the right side window, as bases will update when you focus on notes. But you are welcome to use it however you like.

## Plugins/ Appearances
### Themes

#### FaS (Fancy a Story)

> *<font color=" #7f7f7f">If you swap from this theme, some callouts may break. Infoboxes will still work if you swap to the ITS theme, but when swapping to another theme, you may want to enable the SCallouts snippet.</font>*

FaS is the new kid on the block, taking inspiration from the ITS theme that many of us have used for so long. It gives a clean look with a Dwarven Art Deco vibe. Although FaS is less customizable, the developer is more than happy to provide support where possible, given suggestions.

#### ITS (In The Shadows)

The ITS theme offers an amazing TTRPG-inspired style that can be edited to our preferences within Style Settings. If you want to have a lot of control over your theme, this may be a great option for you.

#### Retroma

This is a very new theme that I stumbled and I really quite like it. It as a Retro vibe that could work depending on your setting.

#### No Theme

Using just the base appearance of Obsidian is also an option, and may help save some performance. We can even use ITS snippets to provide us with useful tools, such as the Infobox callout.

---

### Snippets

#### BannerFade

This snippet enables us to add cool backgrounds to our notes, which fade out as you scroll down. (ITS Theme dependent.)

#### BetterLeafletIcons

 BetterLeafletIcons gives us better-looking icons within our Obsidian leaflets. The design I went for here is based on the Skyrim point of interest icon. I created it, but sailKite vastly improved it.

#### BOTCalloutsDarkmode

This is a collection of Bag of Tips' callouts that are used within this vault.

#### FancyAStoryTweaks

The personal tweaks I have made to the FaS theme.

#### HideNameEmail

Obsidian doesn't allow you to hide your personal details when you go into settings. So I had to make a little snippet that lets me hide it for when I stream/ make videos. You are welcome to keep this or remove it.

#### PropertiesColumns

> *<font color=" #7f7f7f">Disabled by default, enable if you change from FaS and want to use it!</font>*

Allow you to have your properties in 2 columns, making them more visually easy to read.

#### RainbowFolders

> *<font color=" #7f7f7f">Disabled by default, enable if you change from FaS and want to use it!</font>*

Adds a rainbow effect to the colours of the file structure.

#### SCallouts

> *<font color=" #7f7f7f">Depending on which theme you choose, you may want to enable this as it does conflict with the FaS Infoboxes. If you do, you may need to edit other callouts, like the column callout with the FaS grid callout. This is very much where you get to customize your vault.</font>*

Callout snippers made by the creator of the ITS theme, allowing us to use callouts such as the infobox in any theme.

#### Supercharged Links Gen

This is created by the Supercharge links to howls all of that information.

#### TabsInObsidian

This adds tabs in Obsidian (who would have guessed it?) We use this in [[Template - NPC (Tabs)]].

---

### Plugins

#### [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium)

Allows us to create and manage calendars within our vaults.

#### [Custom File Explorer Sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort)

This plugin allows us to organise our folders. We do so by using [[sortspec]] (I recommend using a tool such as Notepad, Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to edit this.)

#### [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

Dataview enables us to search our vault for the relevant information we need, such as identifying the characters within a settlement. Dataview is what allows us to call that information and displays it for us within our note. But now we have Bases. We still keep Dataview around for a few functions around the vault that Bases can't handle. 

#### [Default New Tab Page](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/new-tab-default-page)

Default New Tab Page allows us to set a default page that opens when we open a new tab. For this vault, I have set it to our vault hub.

#### [Dice Roller](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller)

The Dice Roller plugin gives us the ability to roll dice within our notes. This can be done either within the tab on the right-hand side or built into our notes.

#### [Edge TTS](https://github.com/travisvn/obsidian-edge-tts)

If you're like me and get cross-eyed when reading through a lot of information, sometimes having a Text-To-Speech is amazing! In edit mode, highlight what you want read, right click, and select the TTS option.

#### [Editing Toolbar](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar)

The Editing Toolbar provides a toolbar at the top of our screen in edit mode, giving us quick access to key functionality without needing to memorize all the markdown for tasks like underlining, highlighting, and centering.

#### [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)

The Excalidraw plugin enables us to include visual notes within our vault. It enables us to display images, use arrows to highlight key points, and create visual aids like mind-maps and mood boards.

#### [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks)

Whilst I don't use this plugin personally, you may find use for it within your vaults. You can use this to display your creatures, items, and other such relevant information. It also works well with the Dice Roller plugin.

#### [File Color](https://github.com/ecustic/obsidian-file-color)
The file colour plugin allows us to colour files. (Who would have thought!)

#### [Hover Editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor)

> *<font color=" #7f7f7f">Disabled by default, enable if you want to use it!</font>*

The Hover Editor allows us to hover our mouse over a link within our note, and after a couple of seconds, it'll display it in a pop-up tab.

#### [JS Engine (JavaScript)](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin)

**AHHHH, CODING!!!** Don't worry, you don't need to use this if you don't want! We just use this to calculate the age of our characters. So if you don't want that, delete it, and you don't have to worry about it.

#### [Obsidian Leaflet](https://github.com/javalent/obsidian-leaflet)

The Obsidian Leaflet plugin allows us to bring in images and use them as maps within our games.

#### [Meta Bind](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin)

The Meta bind plugin is used in a very small capacity now that we have Bases. We use it to display our properties within our notes and to create buttons for us to call commands with.

#### [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd)

The QuickAdd plugin is one of a few plugins that allows us to quickly and easily create a new note and puts it in a defined folder.

#### [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

Style Settings gives us the ability to edit various settings within our vault, including the appearance and some plugins such as the Supercharge Links

#### [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links)

The Supercharged Links plugin allows us to colour and even add various emojis and formatting to our notes.

#### [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

The Templater plugin provides access to a wide range of cool functionality for creating Templates. However, QuickAdd serves this purpose for us in this vault. Instead, we use Templater for other functionality. For example, if we have a note that contains {{VALUE}}, when we create a new note using that template, it will prompt us to enter this value into the new note.

Please have a read of the templater docs to see what other cool things you can do!

#### [Various Complements](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin)

Various Complements helps us with auto-completion and link suggestions when we're typing out our notes.
